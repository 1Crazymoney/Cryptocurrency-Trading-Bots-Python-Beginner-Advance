# Cryptocurrency-Trading-Bots-Python-Beginner-Advance

Hello and welcome to the code repository of @BlockchainEng Joaquin Roibal. This folder is used as a collection of information that you may find useful for making your own cryptocurrency trading bots and bitcoin bots, or applying advanced trading strategies to the cryptocurrency markets. 

To help you to learn to implement this code as a profitable crypto trader, I have many online resources available. For example:

## Getting Started

To run any of these bots, first download the Roibal fork of 'Python-Binance', install or unzip this code on your computer. Then place whatever bot from this folder (RoibalBot.py) in the Python-Binance/Examples folder and run/edit that file with whatever python IDE you would like. For the more advanced bots you will need to install CCXT (can be installed via pip or pycharm install).

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
